# 42 Common Core

Those projects are part of 42, the usage of this repo without truly understanding it is not recommended, I invite you to compare your code.  
I hope I insisted enough, in case I didn't, I'd like to remember that copying will make your programming experience harder due to the lack of problem solving skills.  
If you are a part of the 42 staff, contact me before taking any kind of actions.  
In case you are not part of the 42 community you are free to get ideas, analyze or learn anything new from those projects. You should check Libft.  
If you want to discuss something about the code, below are some ways of communications:  

Discord: **maniel73**  
42: **mzurera-**

If you are part of the community you should know how to find me.


### Libft
The libft is constantly reciving updates, the idea is to expand libft in a useful and helpful way, some of the future implementations will be:

 - List
 - Stack
 - Queue
 - Binary Trees
 - Map

And ADT in general.
