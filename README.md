# 42

Those projects are part of 42, the usage of this projects without truly understanding them is not recommended, I invite you to compare your code with those.
I hope I insisted enough, in case I didn't, I'd like to remember that copying this code is "cheating" and a long-term problem due to the lack of problem solving skills.
In case you are not part of the 42 community you are free to get ideas, analyze or learn anything new from this projects. You should check Libft.
If you want to discuss something about the code, below are some ways of communications.

### Libft
This project is constantly reciving updates, the idea is to expand this project in a useful and helpful way, some of the future additions are:

 - List (sort, filter, sublist...)
 - Stack (maybe min-max?)
 - Queue
 - Binary Trees
 - Map
